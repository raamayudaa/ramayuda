# Unimportant Writings (Still Written Anyway)

Welcome to this repository.  
It contains writings nobody asked for, nobody sponsored,  
and most likely won’t change anyone’s life — including the writer’s.

If you’re looking for life solutions, feel free to close this tab.  
You won’t find answers here,  
only a collection of unnecessary words that fix absolutely nothing.

## About This Repo

This repo exists because:
- Writing in phone notes feels too personal  
- Writing on social media feels too crowded  
- Writing on GitHub looks productive  

In reality, it’s all the same.
